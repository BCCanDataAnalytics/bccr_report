## Glossary

**Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC)**

The AAPC is a summary measure presented as a percent that describes, on average, how much the trend in incidence rates changed year to year over a given period of interest.

**Cancer Incidence**

The number of new cases of a given type of cancer diagnosed in a specified time period. The basic unit of reporting is a new case of cancer rather than an individual patient.

**Cancer Incidence Rate**

The number of new cases of a given type of cancer per person in the general population (usually expressed as a rate per 100,000 people).

**Cancer** **Mortality**

The number of deaths attributed to a particular type of cancer in a given time period.Â  Included are deaths of patients diagnosed in earlier years, persons with a new diagnosis during the year who died, and patients for whom a diagnosis of cancer is made only after death.

**Cancer Mortality Rate**

The number of new deaths of a given type of cancer per person in the general population (usually expressed as a rate per 100,000 people).

**Trends**

The change in the rate of new cancer cases or deaths in the population over time.

## Cancer site definitions

Table \@ref(tab:cancer) below provides the specific definitions used for the various cancers reported within this report. The definitions for each cancer are based on the ICDO-3 site (topography) and histology (morphology) codes and are provided in the right-hand column of Table A2. In this report we include invasive cancers only with the exception of bladder cancer which includes both invasive and in situ cases.

```

Non-melanoma skin cancers are not including in any of the above cancer types as these are not routinely registered in Canada at this time.

ICD-O-3 refers to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition and ICD-10 refers to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision.
