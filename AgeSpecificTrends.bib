abstract = {Purpose: To analyze trends in invasive cervical cancer incidence by age, histology, and race over a 35-year period (1973-2007) in order to gain insight into changes in the presentation of cervical cancer. Methods: Data from the nine Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries that continuously collected information on invasive cervical cancer were analyzed for trends. Standardized to the 2000 U.S population, annual age-adjusted incidence rates were estimated by race and histologic subtype. Histologic subtype was classified into squamous, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous. Results: Overall incidence rates for invasive cervical cancer decreased by 54{\%} over the 35 years, from 13.07/100,000 (1973-1975) to 6.01/100,000 (2006-2007), and the incidence rates declined by 51{\%} and 70.2{\%}, respectively, among whites and blacks. The incidence rates for squamous carcinoma decreased by 61.1{\%} from 10.2/100,000 (1973-1975) to 3.97/100,000 (2006-2007). Incidence rates for adenosquamous cell carcinomas decreased by 16{\%} from 0.27/100,000 (1973-1975) to 0.23/100,000 (2006-2007), and incidence rates for adenocarcinomas increased by 32.2{\%} from 1.09/100,000 (1973-1975) to 1.44/100,000 (2006-2007). This increase in adenocarcinomas was due to an increase in incidence in white women; a decrease in incidence was observed for black women. Conclusions: Although marked reductions in the overall and race-specific incidence rates of invasive cervical cancer have been achieved, they mask important variation by histologic subtype. These findings suggest that alternatives to Pap smear-based screening, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and HPV vaccination, need to be prioritized if adenocarcinomas of the cervix are to be controlled. {\textcopyright} 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {Because Pap-smear screening can detect pre-invasive cervical cancer, such screening can markedly reduce the occurrence of invasive cancer. However, its impact in different populations is uncertain. This study compares the changes in cervical cancer incidence at different ages after the introduction of screening in different populations, and addresses the impact of organized and opportunistic smear taking. We identified 17 cancer registries large enough and existing long enough to analyze screening effects. For each registry, we calculated the relative reduction in age-specific incidence rates and in incidence rates age-standardized to the world population after the introduction of cytologic screening, In 11 of the 17 populations, age-standardized incidence rates declined markedly from 27 percent in Norway and to 77 percent in Finland, Age-specific declines were confined to women aged 30 to 70 years old with a nadir around ages 40 to 55. In six other populations, age-standardized incidence rates declined less than 25 percent, an amount too small to provide unambiguous evidence of a screening effect. In several populations, cytologic screening had a more pronounced effect than is generally recognized. Because age-specific declines in cervical cancer incidence rates were strikingly similar in populations with widely different screening practices, organized screening may not be markedly superior to opportunistic screening. The reduction in reported cancer incidence because of screening is smaller in younger and older women.},

abstract = {Recent trends of cervical cancer incidence by histology and age in the United States (U.S.) have not been reported. We examined contemporary trends in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) incidence rates in the U.S. by age group, race/ethnicity, and stage at diagnosis after accounting for hysterectomy. Incidence data (1999–2015) were obtained from the U.S. Cancer Statistics Incidence Analytic Database. Hysterectomy prevalence was estimated using National Health Interview Survey data (2000–2015). Overall SCC incidence rates continued to decrease in all racial/ethnic groups except among non-Hispanic whites in whom rates stabilized in the 2010s, largely driven by stable trends in ages {\textless}50 years and a slower pace of decrease in ages 50–59 years. After a stable trend between 1999 and 2002, AC incidence rates among non-Hispanic whites rose during 2002–2015 (1.3{\%} per year), mostly due to increases in ages 40–49 (4.4{\%} annually since 2004) and 50–59 years (5.5{\%} annually since 2011). Overall AC incidence rates during 1999–2015 decreased in blacks and Hispanics but were stable in Asian/Pacific Islanders; in all these race/ethnicities, rates were generally stable in ages {\textless}50 years but decreasing in older ages. Rates of distant stage cervical SCC and AC among non-Hispanic whites increased in several age groups but were generally stable in non-whites. Increasing or stabilized incidence trends for AC and attenuation of earlier declines for SCC in several subpopulations underscore the importance of intensifying efforts to reverse the increasing trends and further reduce the burden of cervical cancer in the U.S.},

Age-adjusted incidence rate of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix decreased from 11.1 per 100,000 women in 1970-72 to 5.3 in 1994-96, while the rate for cervical adenocarcinoma increased from 1.1 per 100,000 women to 1.5 over the same period. Age-adjusted mortality rate declined from 7.9 per 100,000 women in 1953-55 to 1.9 in 1995-97. The patterns in age-specific mortality rates in 1953-72 were different from those in 1973-97; younger women experienced larger reductions in mortality during the earlier period while older women benefited to a greater extent during the latter period. Age-period-cohort modeling showed that cohort effects were responsible for the decreasing trends in incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and increasing trends in adenocarcinoma, and both period and cohort effects account for the observed trends in mortality. The results suggest that Pap smear screening has played a significant role in the reduction in squamous cell cervical carcinoma. The causes for the increase in cervical adenocarcinoma are unclear.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate annually to update cancer rates and trends in the United States. This report updates statistics on lung, female breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers and highlights the uses of selected surveillance data to assist development of state-based cancer control plans. METHODS: Age-adjusted incidence rates from 1996 through 2000 are from state and metropolitan area cancer registries that met NAACCR criteria for highest quality. Death rates are based on underlying cause-of-death data. Long-term trends and rates for major racial and ethnic populations are based on NCI and CDC data. Incidence trends from 1975 through 2000 were adjusted for reporting delays. State-specific screening and risk factor survey data are from the CDC and other federal and private organizations. RESULTS: Cancer incidence rates for all cancer sites combined increased from the mid-1970s through 1992 and then decreased from 1992 through 1995. Observed incidence rates for all cancers combined were essentially stable from 1995 through 2000, whereas the delay-adjusted trend showed an increase that had borderline statistical significance (P =.05). Increases in the incidence rates of breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men offset a long-term decrease in lung cancer in men. Death rates for all cancer sites combined decreased beginning in 1994 and stabilized from 1998 through 2000, resulting in part from recent revisions in cause-of-death codes. Death rates among men continued to decline throughout the 1990s, whereas trends in death rates among women were essentially unchanged from 1998 through 2000. Analysis of state data for the leading cancers revealed mixed progress in achieving national objectives for improving cancer screening, risk factor reduction, and decreases in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Overall cancer incidence and death rates began to stabilize in the mid- to late 1990s. The recent increase in the delay-adjusted trend will require monitoring with additional years of data. Further reduction in the burden of cancer is possible but will require the continuation of strong federal, state, local, and private partnerships to increase dissemination of evidence-based cancer control programs to all segments of the population.

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known cause of cervical cancer, as well as some oropharyngeal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, and anal cancers. To assess trends, characterized by average annual percent change (AAPC), in HPV-associated cancer incidence during 1999-2015, CDC analyzed data from cancer registries covering 97.8{\%} of the U.S. population. A total of 30,115 new cases of HPV-associated cancers were reported in 1999 and 43,371 in 2015. During 1999-2015, cervical cancer rates decreased 1.6{\%} per year; vaginal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) rates decreased 0.6{\%} per year; oropharyngeal SCC rates increased among both men (2.7{\%}) and women (0.8{\%}); anal SCC rates also increased among both men (2.1{\%}) and women (2.9{\%}); vulvar SCC rates increased (1.3{\%}); and penile SCC rates remained stable. In 2015 oropharyngeal SCC (15,479 cases among men and 3,438 among women) was the most common HPV-associated cancer. Continued surveillance through high-quality cancer registries is important to monitor cancer incidence and trends in these potentially preventable cancers. HPV causes cervical cancer and some types of oropharyngeal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, and anal cancer; HPV DNA is found in specific tissue types that include carcinomas of the cervix and SCCs of the vulva, vagina, penis, oropharynx, and anus (1,2). The natural history from HPV infection to precancerous lesion to invasive cervical cancer is well established. HPV is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the United States and is often acquired soon after initiating sexual activity (3). Studies indicate that approximately 90{\%} of new cervical HPV infections, including types that cause cancer, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and those that do not clear take decades to progress to invasive cervical cancer.* Less is known about carcinogenic progression of HPV-associated infection at other anatomic sites (2). CDC analyzed data from population-based cancer registries that participate in the CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program that met the criteria for high data quality for all years from 1999 to 2015; these * Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Chapter 5: Human Papillomavirus (HPV). https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/ chpt05-hpv.html. data cover approximately 97.8{\%} of the U.S. population. † Invasive cancers are not tested for HPV in most cancer registries ; therefore, an HPV-associated cancer was defined as an invasive malignancy in which HPV DNA was frequently found in special studies, including carcinomas of the cervix (i.e., SCC, adenocarcinomas, and other carcinomas) and SCC of the vulva, vagina, penis, oropharynx, and anus (including rectal SCC) (2) and was microscopically confirmed. {\S} Cases were classified by anatomic site and cell type using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition. Oropharyngeal SCC included squamous cell cancer types at the base of tongue, pharyngeal tonsils, anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars, glos-sotonsillar sulci, anterior surface of soft palate and uvula, and lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls. Anal SCC also included rectal SCCs because they are biologically similar and might be misclassified. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 persons and standardized to the 2000 U.S. standard population. Trends were measured with AAPC in rates calculated using joinpoint regression. {\P} Rates were considered to increase if the AAPC was greater than zero (p{\textless}0.05) and to decrease if the AAPC was less than zero (p{\textless}0.05); otherwise, rates were considered stable. A maximum of two joinpoints † Cancer registries' incidence data met the following five United States Cancer Statistics criteria: 1) ≤5{\%} of cases ascertained solely on the basis of death certificate; 2) ≤3{\%} of cases missing information on sex; 3) ≤3{\%} of cases missing information on age; 4) ≤5{\%} of cases missing information on race; and 5) ≥97{\%} of registry's records passed a set of single-field and interfield computerized edits that test the validity and logic of data components. https://gis.cdc.gov/},

abstract = {Background: Although overall cervical cancer incidence rates have decreased in both black and white women in the U.S. since the mid 1950s due to widespread screening, rates continue to be higher among blacks than among whites. However, whether this pattern differs by age is unknown. Methods: Cervical cancer cases (1975-2009, N = 36,503) were obtained from nine Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registries. Age-standardized incidence rates for white and black women were calculated from 1975-1979 through 2005-2009 by age group ({\textless} 50, 50-64, and ≥ 65 years). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) evaluated differences in rates for blacks vs. whites by age group and stage at diagnosis during 1975-1979 and 2005-2009. Results: Among women aged {\textless} 50 years, the black-to-white disparity RR decreased from nearly two-fold (RR, 1.9; 95{\%} CI, 1.7-2.1) during 1975-1979 to unity during 2005-2009 (RR, 0.9; 95{\%} CI, 0.8-1.0). In contrast, rates remained significantly elevated for blacks vs. whites aged 50-64 years (RR, 2.4; 95{\%} CI, 2.1-2.7 and 1.7; 95{\%} CI, 1.5-2.0), and for those aged ≥ 65 years (RR, 3.3; 95{\%} CI, 2.9-3.8 and 2.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.9-2.7) during both time periods, although the disparities decreased over time. Similar disparities persisted for older black women with cervical cancer of all stages. Conclusion: Disparities in cervical cancer incidence rates were eliminated for younger blacks vs. whites but persisted for blacks aged 50 years and older. Additional strategies are needed to increase follow-up and treatment of precancerous lesions among middle-aged and older black women. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To inform future Scandinavian-specific policy analyses, we aimed to provide an overview of cervical cancer epidemiology and existing prevention efforts in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We compiled and summarized data on current prevention strategies, population demography and epidemiology (for example, age-specific HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence over time) for each Scandinavian country by reviewing published literature and official guidelines, performing registry-based analyses using primary data and having discussions with experts in each country. In Scandinavia, opportunistic screening occurred as early as the 1950s and by 1996, all countries had implemented nationwide organized cytology-based screening. Prior to implementation of widespread screening and during 1960–66, cervical cancer incidence was considerably higher in Denmark than in Norway and Sweden. Decades of cytology-based screening later (i.e. 2010–2014), cervical cancer incidence has been considerably reduced and has converged across the countries since the 1960s, although it still remains lowest in Sweden. Generally, Scandinavian countries face similar cervical cancer burdens and utilize similar prevention approaches; however, important differences remain. Future policy analyses will need to evaluate whether these differences warrant differential prevention policies or whether efforts can be streamlined across Scandinavia.},

Methods: Registered cases of cervical cancer and the corresponding person years for the Canadian population were retrieved from an online data repository of the International Agency on Research on Cancer and from Statistics Canada for the period 1978 to 2009.Annual age-standardized rates were estimated for all data combined and for each province separately.The ages of cases were aggregated into three groups: 25 to 39, 40 to 59, and 60 to 75 years.Joinpoint regression analysis was used to describe the trend across age groups and provinces. Results: Between 1978 and 2006, the age-adjusted cervical cancer rate in Canada decreased from 20.05 to 12.66 per 100 000 females; after 2006 the rate increased.Greater reductions were observed in the older age groups.The average annual percentage change (AAPC) was -. 1.1{\%} (95{\%} CI -. 1.1{\%} to 0.09{\%}), -. 1.8{\%} (95{\%} CI -. 2.5{\%} to -. 1.2{\%}), and -. 2.6{\%} (95{\%} CI -. 3.9{\%} to -. 1.4{\%}) for age groups 25 to 39, 40 to 60, and 60 to 75, respectively.The AAPC varied between provinces, ranging from -. 0.22{\%} (95{\%} CI -. 1.4{\%} to 0.9{\%}) in Saskatchewan to -. 3.02{\%} (95{\%} CI -. 4.5{\%} to -. 1.5{\%}) in Newfoundland and Labrador. In Ontario the incidence of cervical cancer increased annually between 2006 and 2009.The trend in British Columbia included a significant change of slope in 1984.

abstract = {The identification of changes in the recent trend is an important issue in the analysis of cancer mortality and incidence data. We apply a joinpoint regression model to describe such continuous changes and use the grid-search method to fit the regression function with unknown joinpoints assuming constant variance and uncorrelated errors. We find the number of significant joinpoints by performing several permutation tests, each of which has a correct significance level asymptotically. Each p-value is found using Monte Carlo methods, and the overall asymptotic significance level is maintained through a Bonferroni correction. These tests are extended to the situation with non-constant variance to handle rates with Poisson variation and possibly autocorrelated errors. The performance of these tests are studied via simulations and the tests are applied to U.S. prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Habbema2012,
abstract = {Context: This article compares cervical cancer screening intensity and cervical cancer mortality trends in the United States and the Netherlands to illustrate the potential of cross-national comparative studies. We discuss the lessons that can be learned from the comparison as well as the challenges in each country to effective and efficient screening. Methods: We used nationally representative data sources in the United States and the Netherlands to estimate the number of Pap smears and the cervical cancer mortality rate since 1950. The following questions are addressed: How do differences in intensity of Pap smear use between the countries translate into differences in mortality trends? Can population coverage rates (the proportion of eligible women who had a Pap smear within a specified period) explain the mortality trends better than the total intensity of Pap smear use? Findings: Even though three to four times more Pap smears per woman were conducted in the United States than in the Netherlands over a period of three decades, the two countries' mortality trends were quite similar. The five-year coverage rates for women aged thirty to sixty-four were quite comparable at 80 to 90 percent. Because screening in the Netherlands was limited to ages thirty to sixty, screening rates for women under thirty and over sixty were much higher in the United States. These differences had consequences for age-specific mortality trends. The relatively good coverage rate in the Netherlands can be traced back to a nationwide invitation system based on municipal population registries. While both countries followed a "policy cycle" involving evidence review, surveillance of screening practices and outcomes, clinical guidelines, and reimbursement policies, the components of this cycle were more systematically linked and implemented nationwide in the Netherlands than in the United States. To a large extent, this was facilitated by a public health model of screening in the Netherlands, rather than a medical services model. Conclusions: Cross-country studies like ours are natural experiments that can produce insights not easily obtained from other types of study. The cervical cancer screening system in the Netherlands seems to have been as effective as the U.S. system but used much less screening. Adequate coverage of the female population at risk seems to be of central importance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Milbank Memorial Fund.},

abstract = {High levels of participation in cervical screening are reported in Canada from the 1970's as a result of early uptake of the Pap smear and universal Medicare. Despite recommendations to the contrary, the programs have featured early age of initiation of screening and frequent screening intervals. Other countries have achieved successful outcomes without such features. We analyzed national data to better understand mortality and incidence trends, and their relationships to screening. The Canadian Cancer Registry, National Cancer Incidence Reporting System, and the Canadian Vital Statistics Database were used to measure mortality and incidence rates. Cases and deaths from invasive cervical cancer were classified by 5 year age groups at diagnosis and death (15 to 19 years through to 80 to 84 years), year of diagnosis (1972 to 2006), and year of death (1932 to 2006). Probabilities of developing and dying from cervical cancer were calculated for age-specific mortality and incidence. The proportion of women reporting a timely Pap test was estimated for 1978 to 2006. Cervical cancer mortality has declined steadily from a peak of 13.5 to 2.2 per 100,000 (83{\%},) between 1952 and 2006, and 71{\%} between 1972 and 2006. Incidence of invasive cervical cancer has declined by 58{\%} since 1972. These declines have occurred more among older age groups than younger. Invasive cervical cancer incidence and mortality is less in each successive birth cohort of women. Participation rates in screening are high especially in women under age 50. Despite increasing risk factors for cervical cancer, both incidence and mortality have declined over time, across age groups, and across birth cohorts. Earlier increasing mortality (1932 - 1950) was likely related to improved classification of cancers and the early subsequent reduction (1950 - 1970) to improved treatment. Recent improvements in incidence and mortality are likely due to high rates of screening. For women under age 30 years there are low rates of disease but lesser improvement related to screening.},

abstract = {A screening programme to detect preinvasive carcinoma of the cervix was started in British Columbia in 1949. Since 1970 the number of women who have been screened at least once has been maintained at about 85{\%} of the population at risk. More than 500000 cervical smears are being examined each year in the central laboratory. There has been an appreciable increase in the number of cases and rates of carcinoma in situ seen since 1970, particularly in women between 20 and 30 years of age. Since the programme started over 26 000 cases of squamous carcinoma in situ have been detected and treated. The incidence of clinically invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix has fallen by 78{\%} during the period under review, and mortality from squamous carcinoma of the cervix has fallen by 72{\%}. A colposcopy programme, introduced throughout British Columbia over the past 12 years, has been important in reducing the problems of managing preinvasive lesions, particularly in younger women. It is concluded that the reduction in morbidity and mortality from invasive squamous cancer of the cervix in British Columbia over the past 30 years is directly attributable to the province wide screening programme and that a large potential increase in invasive cervical cancer rates among younger women is being prevented. {\textcopyright} 1988, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although cancer incidence over time is well documented in Canada, trends by birth cohort and age group are less well known. We analyzed age- and sex-standardized incidence trends in Canada for 16 major cancer sites and all cancers combined. METHODS: We obtained nationally representative population-based cancer incidence data in Canada between 1971 and 2015 from the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System (1969–1992) and the Canadian Cancer Registry (1992–2015). We analyzed cancer-incidence trends, reported as annual percent change (APC) for each 10-year group from age 20 to 89 years. We also estimated age-adjusted incidence rate ratios from fitted birth cohort models. RESULTS: Across most age categories, the most recent trends show significant decreases in the incidence of cervical (APC –8.8{\%} to –0.33{\%}), lung (men: –7.42{\%} to –0.36{\%}; women: –6.27{\%} to 1.07{\%}), bladder (women: –4.12{\%} to –0.07{\%}; men: –5.13{\%} to –0.38{\%}) and prostate cancer (–11.11{\%} to –1.11{\%}). Significant increasing trends were observed for kidney, thyroid and uterine cancers. Overall incidence has increased among both sexes younger than 50 years of age, with recent increases in pancreatic cancer among men, breast cancer among women and colorectal cancer among both sexes. From the birth cohort analysis, we observed increasing trends in colorectal, liver and prostate cancers among men; kidney cancer and melanoma among women; and thyroid cancer among both sexes. We observed decreasing trends in cervical and ovarian cancers, and in bladder and lung cancers among men. INTERPRETATION: Cancer incidence is decreasing at many sites targeted by primary-prevention efforts, such as smoking cessation and screening programs. Substantial increases in incidence among younger populations are driven by cancers possibly associated with obesity.},

abstract = {Background: Cervical cancer trends in a given country mainly depend on the existence of effective screening programmes and time changes in disease risk factors, notably exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV). Screening primarily influences variations by period of diagnosis, whereas changes in risk factors chiefly manifest themselves as variations in risk across successive birth cohorts of women. Methods: We assessed trends in cervical cancer across 38 countries in five continents, age group 30-74 years, using age-standardised incidence rates (ASRs) and age-period-cohort (APC) models. Non-identifiability in APC models was circumvented by making assumptions based on a consistent relationship between age and cervical cancer incidence (i.e. approximately constant rates after age 45 years). Findings: ASRs decreased in several countries, except in most of Eastern European populations , Thailand as well as Uganda, although the direction and magnitude of period and birth cohort effects varied substantially. Strong downward trends in cervical cancer risk by period were found in the highest-income countries, whereas no clear changes by period were found in lower-resourced settings. Successive generations of women born after 1940 or 1950 exhibited either an increase in risk of cervical cancer (in most European countries, Japan, China), no substantial changes (North America and Australia) or a decrease (Ecuador and India). Interpretation: In countries where effective screening has been in place for a long time the consequences of underlying increases in cohort-specific risk were largely avoided. In the absence of screening, cohort-led increases or, stable, cervical cancer ASRs were observed. Our study underscores the importance of strengthening screening efforts and augmenting existing cancer control efforts with HPV vaccination, notably in those countries where unfavourable cohort effects are continuing or emerging.

abstract = {Rapid increases in cervical adenocarcinoma incidence have been observed in Western countries in recent decades. Postulated explanations include an increasing specificity of subtype-the capability to diagnose the disease, an inability of cytologic screening to reduce adenocarcinoma, and heterogeneity in cofactors related to persistent human papillomavirus infection. This study examines the possible contribution of these factors in relation with trends observed in Europe. Age-period-cohort models were fitted to cervical adenocarcinoma incidence trends in women ages {\textless}75 in 13 European countries. Age-adjusted adenocarcinoma incidence rates increased throughout Europe, the rate of increase ranging from around 0.5{\%} per annum in Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland to {\textgreater}3{\%} in Finland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The increases first affected generations born in the early 1930s through the mid-1940s, with risk invariably higher in women born in the mid-1960s relative to those born 20 years earlier. The magnitude of this risk ratio varied considerably from around 7 in Slovenia to almost unity in France. Declines in period-specific risk were observed in United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden, primarily among women ages {\textgreater}30. Whereas increasing specificity of subtype with time may be responsible for some of the increases in several countries, the changing distribution and prevalence of persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus types, alongside an inability to detect cervical adenocarcinoma within screening programs, would accord with the temporal profile observed in Europe. The homogeneity of trends in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in birth cohort is consistent with the notion that they share a similar etiology irrespective of the differential capability of screen detection. Screening may have had at least some impact in reducing cervical adenocarcinoma incidence in several countries during the 1990s.

abstract = {Purpose: The incidence of cervical cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), has been decreasing in several developed countries since the onset of organized screening programs; in some countries, however, the incidence of adenocarcinoma has increased among young women. We investigated the Danish incidence trends during 1997–2011 when cervical screening coverage was high. Incidences of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) were also assessed, with the latest part of the study period coinciding with introduction of free-of-charge human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Methods: Using nationwide registries, we estimated age-specific and age-standardized incidence rates and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). Results: The incidence of SCC decreased significantly, especially in women aged ≥45 years [EAPC: −3.1 {\%} (95 {\%} CI −4.3 to −2.5)], whereas the incidence of adenocarcinoma increased significantly, from 2.4 to 3.1/100,000 primarily due to increases in women aged ≤44 years [EAPC: 4.3 {\%} (95 {\%} CI 1.8–6.7)]. The incidences of CIN3 and AIS increased significantly from 94.7 to 156.5/100,000 and 3.3 to 11.3/100,000, respectively, but, importantly, they decreased significantly during 2009–2012 in women aged ≤20 years. Conclusions: The Danish screening program has successfully reduced the incidence of cervical cancer, especially of SCC in older women; however, the program has not significantly reduced the incidence in young women or the incidence of adenocarcinoma, which is increasing. Decreases in the incidences of CIN3 and AIS in age groups with high HPV vaccine coverage may herald a future decrease in cervical cancer incidence in young Danish women.},

abstract = {Despite there being sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of screening by cytology in preventing cancer of the cervix uteri, screening policies vary widely among European countries, and incidence is increasing in younger women. This study analyzes trends in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix uteri in 13 European countries to evaluate effectiveness of screening against a background of changing risk. Age-period-cohort models were fitted and period and cohort effects were estimated; these were considered as primarily indicative of screening interventions and changing etiology, respectively. A unique set of estimates was derived by fixing age slopes to one of several plausible age curves under the assumption that the relation between age and cervical cancer incidence is biologically determined. There were period-specific declines in cervical SCC in several countries, with the largest decreases seen in northern Europe. A pattern emerged across Europe of escalating risk in successive generations born after 1930. In the western European countries, a decrease followed by a stabilization of risk by cohort was accompanied by period-specific declines. In southern Europe, stable period, but increasing cohort trends, were observed. Substantial changes have occurred in cervical SCC incidence in Europe and well-organized screening programs have been highly effective in reducing the incidence of cervical SCC. Screening and changing sexual mores largely explain the changing period- and cohort-specific patterns, respectively. The increasing risk in recent cohorts is of obvious concern particularly in countries where no screening programs are in place. Further investigation of the effectiveness of opportunistic screening is warranted as is the observation of differing risk patterns in young cohorts in countries with relatively similar societal structures.

abstract = {Background:In England, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women aged under 35 years. Overall incidence of cervical cancer has decreased since the introduction of the national screening programme in 1988 but recent trends of incidence in young women have not been studied in detail.Methods: Information on 71 511 incident cases of cervical cancer in England, 1982-2006, in 20-79-year-olds was extracted from a national cancer registration database. Changes in incidence were analysed by age group, time period and birth cohort. Poisson regression was used to estimate annual percentage change (APC).Results:Overall incidence, during 1982-2006, fell significantly from 213 to 112 per million person years. However, in 20-29-year-olds, after an initial fall, incidence increased significantly during 1992-2006, (APC 2.16). In 30-39-year-olds incidence stabilised during the latter part of the study period. The pattern was most marked in the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber and East Midlands regions. Birth cohorts that were initially called for screening between 60-64 and 35-39 years of age show an incidence peak soon after the age of presumed first screen, whereas younger birth cohorts show a peak at about 35 years of age. Incidence in the 1977-1981 birth cohort has increased relative to that among women born between 1962 and 1976.Conclusion:These results have implications for cervical screening, human papilloma virus vaccination and other public health interventions targeting young people. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objectives: Examine long-term incidence trends of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancer in Norway, and estimate the number of cancer cases preventable by vaccines against HPV 16/18 or HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58. Design: Observational registry-based study. We extracted incident cases of HPV-related cancer during 1953-2015 from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Tumour HPV prevalence estimates from large international meta-analyses or from Norway were used to estimate the protective potential of HPV vaccines. Participants and setting: The Norwegian population. Primary outcome measures: Incidence trend analyses during 1953-2015 for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix, vulva, vagina, oropharynx, anus and penis, and adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Additionally, the number of cancer cases preventable by HPV vaccination. Results: Among women, incidences of SCC of the anus, oropharynx, vulva and cervical adenocarcinoma increased, while vaginal SCC showed no trend. For these cancers combined, the average annual percentage change (AAPC) during 1953-2015 was 1.2 (95{\%} CI 0.7 to 1.6). The incidence of cervical SCC generally decreased during 1976-2004 and remained stable thereafter. Among men, incidences of SCC of the anus, oropharynx and penis increased. The AAPC during 1953-2015 combined for all male HPV-related cancer was 1.9 (95{\%} CI 1.3 to 2.5). A vaccine against HPV 16/18 might yearly prevent 402 (95{\%} CI 382 to 420) cancers. A vaccine against HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58 might yearly prevent 478 (95{\%} CI 464 to 490) cancers, of which 206 (95{\%} CI 202 to 209) occur in non-cervical organs, and 113 (95{\%} CI 110 to 115) occur among men. Conclusions: The incidences of HPV-related cancers that are not effectively prevented by screening have generally increased during 1953-2015. HPV vaccination can prevent a substantial number of cancers in Norway, in cervical and non-cervical organs, among women and men.},

abstract = {Objective: The utility of screening young women for cervical cancer is questionable given the likelihood of pre-cancer regression and the potential harm of the intervention. Our objective was to determine the incidence and mortality rates of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) in women aged 15 to 29 years and to assess changes in rates since the uptake of screening. Methods: The incidence of ICC cases from 1970 to 2007 was obtained from records in the Canadian Cancer Registry and from the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System. Mortality rates in women with ICC for the same time period were obtained from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database. Data were classified by age group and year at diagnosis or death, assessed at five-year intervals. The incidence was further analyzed according to histology. Results: ICC among 15- to 19-year-olds is rare and has remained relatively constant from 1970-1974 to 2005-2007. From 1975-1979 to 2005-2007, the incidence in 20- to 24-year-olds declined from 3.2 to 1.2 per 100 000. From 1980-1984 to 2005-2007, the incidence in 25- to 29-year-olds declined from 11.1 to 6.3 per 100 000. Deaths among 15- to 19-year-olds and 20- to 24-year-olds are rare, but in 25- to 29-year-olds mortality declined from 0.9 to 0.5 per 100 000 between 1975-1979 and 2005-2007. Among 20- to 24-year-olds, rates of all cervical cancers and squamous cell carcinomas declined, while adenocarcinomas and unknown types were rare. In 25- to 29-year-olds there was a decline in all cervical cancers and squamous cell cancers and an apparent increase in adenocarcinoma. Conclusions: ICC in adolescents is rare and does not justify population-based screening. Screening appears to have affected the incidence of ICC in 20- to 24-year olds and incidence and mortality from ICC in 25- to 29-year-olds.},

abstract = {Objectives To better model underlying trends in cervical cancer incidence so as to model past trends, to estimate the impact of cervical screening on cervical cancer rates at different ages and to obtain a counterfactual baseline under a no-screening scenario. Design Trend analysis of cancer registry data recorded between 1971 and 2013. Setting England. Participants 132 493 women aged 20-84 with a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Outcome measure Cervical cancer incidence data were modelled using a modified age period cohort model able to capture both increased exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV) as well as changes in the age of exposure to HPV in young cohorts. Observed rates were compared with counterfactual baseline rates under a no-screening scenario to estimate the protective effect of screening. Results Rates of cervical cancer incidence have been decreasing since the introduction of screening but are projected to increase in the future under the current scenario. Between 1988 and 2013, it was estimated that screening had prevented approximately 65 000 cancers. Moreover, in 2013, the age-standardised rate (ASR) estimated under the no-screening scenario (37.9, 95{\%} CI 37.4 to 38.3) was threefold higher among women aged 20-84 than the observed ASR (12.8, 95{\%} CI 12.3 to 13.3). We estimate that the age of first HPV exposure has decreased by about 1 year every decade since the early 1970s (women born in 1955 onwards). Conclusions Our results corroborated the importance of screening in preventing cervical cancer and indicated future rates are dependent on age at HPV exposure. Estimated future rates can be used for healthcare planning while the counterfactual baseline to quantify the impact of HPV vaccination in microsimulations.},

Six population-based data sources were linked at an individual level. Negative binomial regression was used to compare Pap test utilization and results between FN and all other Manitoba (AOM) women. Poisson regression was used to compare cervical cancer incidence. Among women younger than 25 years, FN were more likely than AOMwomen to have had a Pap test [rate ratio (RR) = 1.37, 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI), 1.22-1.53, 18-19 year olds; RR = 1.17, 95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.31, 20-24 year olds]. There was no difference in Pap test use for women 25 to 29 or 30 to 39 years. FN 40 years and older were less likely to have a Pap test than AOM women (RR = 0.84, 95{\%} CI, 0.75-0.93, 40-49 years old; RR = 0.71, 95{\%} CI, 0.63-0.79, 50-59 years old; RR = 0.59, 95{\%} CI, 0.52-0.66, 60-69 years old). FN were more likely than AOM women to have a high (RR = 1.88, 95{\%} CI, 1.65-2.13) or low-grade Pap test result (RR = 1.60, 95{\%} CI, 1.48-1.73). The invasive cervical cancer incidence rate was double for FN women 25 to 39 years of age (21.9 per 100,000, FN; 10.2 per 100,000, AOM, P = 0.006) and 40 to 69 years of age (24.3 per 100,000, FN; 12.3 per 100,000, AOM, P = 0.007). In conclusion, cervical cancer screening among FN women over 40 years of age must be increased to address the higher cervical cancer incidence.},

abstract = {Objectives: Estimate site-specific cancer incidence rates for a wide range of cancers in First Nations adults in Canada, and compare these with rates in non-Aboriginal adults. Methods: Responses from persons aged 25 and older to the 1991 Long Form Census were linked to national mortality and cancer databases. First Nations- and non-Aboriginal-specific incidence rates were age-standardized to the world standard population. The sex- and site-specific relative risks (RR) of cancer in First Nations compared to those in non-Aboriginal adults were estimated with Poisson regression. Results were stratified by residence on-reserve (all cancers combined) and region of Canada (four most common cancer sites). Results: Compared to non-Aboriginal adults, First Nations had higher incidence of colon and rectum, kidney, cervix, and liver cancers and lower incidence of prostate, breast, bladder, uterus, ovary, and brain cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and melanoma. First Nations women additionally had higher incidence of stomach, gallbladder, and laryngeal cancers and lower incidence of thyroid cancers compared to non-Aboriginal women. The higher relative incidence of stomach and gallbladder cancers was observed only among First Nations adults who reported living on-reserve. Incidence of lung cancer was similar for First Nations and non-Aboriginal adults nationally, though variation by region of Canada was observed. Conclusion: First Nations people in Canada have disproportionately high rates of certain cancers, providing evidence to support public health policy and programming. More research is needed to identify factors contributing to the significantly lower incidence observed for various cancer types. Novel methods for studying disparities in cancer incidence among First Nations people are required to support ongoing cancer control planning and advocacy.},

@article{Arbyn2020,
abstract = {Background: The knowledge that persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main cause of cervical cancer has resulted in the development of prophylactic vaccines to prevent HPV infection and HPV assays that detect nucleic acids of the virus. WHO has launched a Global Initiative to scale up preventive, screening, and treatment interventions to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem during the 21st century. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the existing burden of cervical cancer as a baseline from which to assess the effect of this initiative. Methods: For this worldwide analysis, we used data of cancer estimates from 185 countries from the Global Cancer Observatory 2018 database. We used a hierarchy of methods dependent on the availability and quality of the source information from population-based cancer registries to estimate incidence of cervical cancer. For estimation of cervical cancer mortality, we used the WHO mortality database. Countries were grouped in 21 subcontinents and were also categorised as high-resource or lower-resource countries, on the basis of their Human Development Index. We calculated the number of cervical cancer cases and deaths in a given country, directly age-standardised incidence and mortality rate of cervical cancer, indirectly standardised incidence ratio and mortality ratio, cumulative incidence and mortality rate, and average age at diagnosis. Findings: Approximately 570 000 cases of cervical cancer and 311 000 deaths from the disease occurred in 2018. Cervical cancer was the fourth most common cancer in women, ranking after breast cancer (2{\textperiodcentered}1 million cases), colorectal cancer (0{\textperiodcentered}8 million) and lung cancer (0{\textperiodcentered}7 million). The estimated age-standardised incidence of cervical cancer was 13{\textperiodcentered}1 per 100 000 women globally and varied widely among countries, with rates ranging from less than 2 to 75 per 100 000 women. Cervical cancer was the leading cause of cancer-related death in women in eastern, western, middle, and southern Africa. The highest incidence was estimated in Eswatini, with approximately 6{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} of women developing cervical cancer before age 75 years. China and India together contributed more than a third of the global cervical burden, with 106 000 cases in China and 97 000 cases in India, and 48 000 deaths in China and 60 000 deaths in India. Globally, the average age at diagnosis of cervical cancer was 53 years, ranging from 44 years (Vanuatu) to 68 years (Singapore). The global average age at death from cervical cancer was 59 years, ranging from 45 years (Vanuatu) to 76 years (Martinique). Cervical cancer ranked in the top three cancers affecting women younger than 45 years in 146 (79{\%}) of 185 countries assessed. Interpretation: Cervical cancer continues to be a major public health problem affecting middle-aged women, particularly in less-resourced countries. The global scale-up of HPV vaccination and HPV-based screening—including self-sampling—has potential to make cervical cancer a rare disease in the decades to come. Our study could help shape and monitor the initiative to eliminate cervical cancer as a major public health problem.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer projections to the current year help in policy development, planning of programs and allocation of resources. We sought to provide an overview of the expected incidence and mortality of cancer in Canada in 2020 in followup to the Canadian Cancer Statistics2019report. METHODS: We obtained incidence data from the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System (1984-1991) and Canadian Cancer Registry (1992-2015). Mortality data (1984-2015) were obtained from the Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database. All databases are maintained by Statistics Canada. Cancer incidence and mortality counts and agestandardized rates were projected to 2020 for 23 cancer types by sex and geographic region (provinces and territories) for all ages combined. RESULTS: An estimated 225 800 new cancer cases and 83 300 cancer deaths are expected in Canada in 2020. The most commonly diagnosed cancers are expected to be lung overall (29 800), breast in females (27 400) and prostate in males (23 300). Lung cancer is also expected to be the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for 25.5{\%} of all cancer deaths, followed by colorectal (11.6{\%}), pancreatic (6.4{\%}) and breast (6.1{\%}) cancers. Incidence and mortality rates will be generally higher in the eastern provinces than in the western provinces. INTERPRETATION: The number of cancer cases and deaths remains high in Canada and, owing to the growing and aging population, is expected to continue to increase. Although progress has been made in reducing deaths for most major cancers (breast, prostate and lung), there has been limited progress for pancreatic cancer, which is expected to be the third leading cause of cancer death in Canada in 2020. Additional efforts to improve uptake of existing programs, as well as to advance research, prevention, screening and treatment, are needed to address the cancer burden in Canada.},
