abstract = {Background:Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) of thyroid cancer (TC) have increased in many parts of the world, primarily because of increased papillary TC detection.While rapid increases in TC incidence have also been reported in Canada, an analysis of incidence and survival by histologic subtype has been lacking.Moreover, recent data points in Canada suggest that the era of rapid annual increases may have ended.Data and methods: Data are from the Canadian Cancer Registry, the Canadian Vital Statistics-Death Database and an analytic file linking the two. Annual percent changes (APCs) in incidence and mortality rates are estimated using Joinpoint regression. Net survival (NS) is derived using the Pohar Perme estimator. Results: Among females, TC ASIRs decreased by 3.0{\%} annually from 2012 to 2016, following years of rapid growth. Among males, a long period of rapid increase ended in 2012 with no subsequent decline. For both sexes the overall incidence trend was driven by changes over time in papillary TC and incidence trends in non-papillary TC varied significantly. From 1992 to 2016, TC mortality rates were stable among females and increased slightly among males (APC = 1.2). Five-year NS was higher among papillary cases (99{\%}) than among non-papillary cases (80{\%}) and among females (99{\%}) than among males (94{\%}). Overall, five-year NS increased by 2.1 percentage points from the period from 1992 to 1996 to the period from 2010 to 2014. Interpretation: The results of this study confirm the central role of papillary TC cases in TC incidence and survival trends in Canada. Given recent changes in trend and TC management guidelines, projected increases in TC rates after 2016 could be re-examined.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although cancer incidence over time is well documented in Canada, trends by birth cohort and age group are less well known. We analyzed age- and sex-standardized incidence trends in Canada for 16 major cancer sites and all cancers combined. METHODS: We obtained nationally representative population-based cancer incidence data in Canada between 1971 and 2015 from the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System (1969–1992) and the Canadian Cancer Registry (1992–2015). We analyzed cancer-incidence trends, reported as annual percent change (APC) for each 10-year group from age 20 to 89 years. We also estimated age-adjusted incidence rate ratios from fitted birth cohort models. RESULTS: Across most age categories, the most recent trends show significant decreases in the incidence of cervical (APC –8.8{\%} to –0.33{\%}), lung (men: –7.42{\%} to –0.36{\%}; women: –6.27{\%} to 1.07{\%}), bladder (women: –4.12{\%} to –0.07{\%}; men: –5.13{\%} to –0.38{\%}) and prostate cancer (–11.11{\%} to –1.11{\%}). Significant increasing trends were observed for kidney, thyroid and uterine cancers. Overall incidence has increased among both sexes younger than 50 years of age, with recent increases in pancreatic cancer among men, breast cancer among women and colorectal cancer among both sexes. From the birth cohort analysis, we observed increasing trends in colorectal, liver and prostate cancers among men; kidney cancer and melanoma among women; and thyroid cancer among both sexes. We observed decreasing trends in cervical and ovarian cancers, and in bladder and lung cancers among men. INTERPRETATION: Cancer incidence is decreasing at many sites targeted by primary-prevention efforts, such as smoking cessation and screening programs. Substantial increases in incidence among younger populations are driven by cancers possibly associated with obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Cancer Institute, and North American Association of Central Cancer Registries provide annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends by cancer type, sex, race, ethnicity, and age in the United States. This year's report highlights the cancer burden among men and women age 20-49 years. METHODS: Incidence data for the years 1999 to 2015 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention- and National Cancer Institute-funded population-based cancer registry programs compiled by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and death data for the years 1999 to 2016 from the National Vital Statistics System were used. Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates, estimated by joinpoint, were expressed as average annual percent change. RESULTS: Overall cancer incidence rates (per 100 000) for all ages during 2011-2015 were 494.3 among male patients and 420.5 among female patients; during the same time period, incidence rates decreased 2.1{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = -2.6{\%} to -1.6{\%}) per year in men and were stable in females. Overall cancer death rates (per 100 000) for all ages during 2012-2016 were 193.1 among male patients and 137.7 among female patients. During 2012-2016, overall cancer death rates for all ages decreased 1.8{\%} (95{\%} CI = -1.8{\%} to -1.8{\%}) per year in male patients and 1.4{\%} (95{\%} CI = -1.4{\%} to -1.4{\%}) per year in females. Important changes in trends were stabilization of thyroid cancer incidence rates in women and rapid declines in death rates for melanoma of the skin (both sexes). Among adults age 20-49 years, overall cancer incidence rates were substantially lower among men (115.3 per 100 000) than among women (203.3 per 100 000); cancers with the highest incidence rates (per 100 000) among men were colon and rectum (13.1), testis (10.7), and melanoma of the skin (9.8), and among women were breast (73.2), thyroid (28.4), and melanoma of the skin (14.1). During 2011 to 2015, the incidence of all invasive cancers combined among adults age 20-49 years decreased -0.7{\%} (95{\%} CI = -1.0{\%} to -0.4{\%}) among men and increased among women (1.3{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 0.7{\%} to 1.9{\%}). The death rate for (per 100 000) adults age 20-49 years for all cancer sites combined during 2012 to 2016 was 22.8 among men and 27.1 among women; during the same time period, death rates decreased 2.3{\%} (95{\%} CI = -2.4{\%} to -2.2{\%}) per year among men and 1.7{\%} (95{\%} CI = -1.8{\%} to -1.6{\%}) per year among women. CONCLUSIONS: Among people of all ages and ages 20-49 years, favorable as well as unfavorable trends in site-specific cancer incidence were observed, whereas trends in death rates were generally favorable. Characterizing the cancer burden may inform research and cancer-control efforts.},

OBJECTIVE To evaluate histologically confirmed cumulative incident cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) detected up to and including 48 months by primary HPV testing alone (intervention) or liquid-based cytology (control). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted in an organized Cervical Cancer Screening Programin Canada. Participantswere recruited through 224 collaborating clinicians from January 2008toMay 2012, with follow-up through December 2016. Women aged 25 to 65 years with no history of CIN2+ in the past 5 years, no history of invasive cervical cancer, or no history of hysterectomy;whohave not received a Papanicolaou test within the past 12 months; andwhowere not receiving immunosuppressive therapywere eligible. INTERVENTIONS A total of 19 009 women were randomized to the intervention (n = 9552) and control (n = 9457) groups.Women in the intervention group received HPV testing; those whose results were negative returned at 48 months.Women in the control group received liquid-based cytology (LBC) testing; those whose results were negative returned at 24 months for LBC.Women in the control group who were negative at 24 months returned at 48 months. At 48-month exit, both groups received HPV and LBC co-testing. MAINOUTCOMESANDMEASURES Theprimaryoutcomewasthecumulativeincidence ofCIN3+48 months following randomization. The cumulative incidence of CIN2+was a secondary outcome. RESULTS Among 19 009 women who were randomized (mean age, 45 years [10th-90th percentile, 30-59]), 16 374 (8296 [86.9{\%}] in the intervention group and 8078 [85.4{\%}] in the control group) completed the study. At 48 months, significantly fewer CIN3+ and CIN2+ were detected in the intervention vs control group.

abstract = {Recent analyses in the United States have shown an overall decrease in the incidence of colorectal cancer despite contrasting increases in younger age groups. We examined whether these cohort trends are occurring in Canada. Age-specific trends in colon and rectal cancer incidence in Canada from the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System (1969–1992) and the Canadian Cancer Registry (1992–2012) were analyzed. We estimated annual percent changes (APC) with the Joinpoint Regression Program from the Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Birth cohort effects were estimated using 5-year groups starting in 1888. Age-specific prevalence of class I, II and III obesity in Canada was examined from the National Population Health Survey (1994–2001) and the Canadian Community Health Survey (2001–2011). The reductions in CRC incidence among Canadians are limited to older populations. While reductions among younger age groups (20–29 year olds (yo), 30–39 yo and 40–50 yo) were observed between 1969 and 1995, rates have returned to and surpassed historical levels (APCs 20–29 yo colon cancer = 6.24{\%}, APCs 20–29 yo rectal cancer = 1.5{\%}). Recent birth cohorts (1970–1990) have the highest incidence rate ratios ever recorded. Ecologic trends in obesity prevalence among these birth cohorts in Canada are suggestive of an impact on increasing incidence trends. Furthermore, obesity prevalence estimates suggest that these trends may continue to increase justifying further examination of the etiologic associations and biological impacts of excess adipose tissue among younger populations. While population-based screening of younger age groups deserves careful consideration, these concerning observed trends warrant public health action to address the growing obesity epidemic.},

It is unclear whether the increasing incidence of papillary thyroid cancer has been related to thyroid cancer mortality trends. OBJECTIVE To compare trends in thyroid cancer incidence and mortality by tumor characteristics at diagnosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Trends in thyroid cancer incidence and incidence-based mortality rates were evaluated using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-9 (SEER-9) cancer registry program, and annual percent change in rates was calculated using log-linear regression. EXPOSURE Tumor characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual percent changes in age-Adjusted thyroid cancer incidence and incidence-based mortality rates by histologic type and SEER stage for cases diagnosed during 1974-2013. RESULTS Among 77 276 patients (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 48 [16] years; 58 213 [75{\%}] women) diagnosed with thyroid cancer from 1974-2013, papillary thyroid cancer was the most common histologic type (64 625 cases), and 2371 deaths from thyroid cancer occurred during 1994-2013. Thyroid cancer incidence increased, on average, 3.6{\%}per year (95{\%}CI, 3.2{\%}-3.9{\%}) during 1974-2013 (from 4.56 per 100 000 person-years in 1974-1977 to 14.42 per 100 000 person-years in 2010-2013), primarily related to increases in papillary thyroid cancer (annual percent change, 4.4{\%}[95{\%}CI, 4.0{\%}-4.7{\%}]). Papillary thyroid cancer incidence increased for all SEER stages at diagnosis (4.6{\%}per year for localized, 4.3{\%}per year for regional, 2.4{\%}per year for distant, 1.8{\%}per year for unknown). During 1994-2013, incidence-based mortality increased 1.1{\%} per year (95{\%}CI, 0.6{\%}-1.6{\%}) (from 0.40 per 100 000 person-years in 1994-1997 to 0.46 per 100 000 person-years in 2010-2013) overall and 2.9{\%} per year (95{\%}CI, 1.1{\%}-4.7{\%}) for SEER distant stage papillary thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients in the United States diagnosed with thyroid cancer from 1974-2013, the overall incidence of thyroid cancer increased 3{\%}annually, with increases in the incidence rate and thyroid cancer mortality rate for advanced-stage papillary thyroid cancer. These findings are consistent with a true increase in the occurrence of thyroid cancer in the United States.},

We aimed to evaluate the global geographical variation in SC incidence and temporal trends from 1978 to 2007, with an emphasis on the effect of birth cohort. Joinpoint regression and age–period–cohort model were applied. From 2003 to 2007, male rate were 1.5- to 3-fold higher than female in all countries. Rates were highest in Eastern Asian and South American countries. Except for Uganda, all countries showed favorable trends. Pronounced cohort-specific increases in risk for recent birth cohorts were seen in Brazil, Colombia, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway, Uganda and US white people for males and in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Iceland, India, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uganda, US black and white people for females. The cohort-specific ratio for male significantly decreased in Japan, Malta and Spain for cohorts born since 1950 and in Austria, China, Croatia, Ecuador, Russia, Switzerland and Thailand for cohorts born since 1960 and for female in Japan for cohorts born since 1950 and in Canada, China, Croatia, Latvia, Russia and Thailand for cohorts born since 1960. Disparities in incidence and carcinogenic risk persist worldwide. The favorable trends may be due to changes in environmental exposure and lifestyle, including decreased Helicobacter pylori prevalence, increased intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, the availability of refrigeration and decreased intake of salted and preserved food and smoking prevalence.},

abstract = {Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in the United States is declining rapidly overall but, curiously, is increasing among young adults. Age-specific and birth cohort patterns can provide etiologic clues, but have not been recently examined. Methods: CRC incidence trends in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results areas from 1974 to 2013 (n = 490 305) were analyzed by five-year age group and birth cohort using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and age-period-cohort modeling. Results: After decreasing in the previous decade, colon cancer incidence rates increased by 1.0{\%} to 2.4{\%} annually since the mid-1980s in adults age 20 to 39 years and by 0.5{\%} to 1.3{\%} since the mid-1990s in adults age 40 to 54 years; rectal cancer incidence rates have been increasing longer and faster (eg, 3.2{\%} annually from 1974-2013 in adults age 20-29 years). In adults age 55 years and older, incidence rates generally declined since the mid-1980s for colon cancer and since 1974 for rectal cancer. From 1989-1990 to 2012-2013, rectal cancer incidence rates in adults age 50 to 54 years went from half those in adults age 55 to 59 to equivalent (24.7 vs 24.5 per 100 000 persons: IRR = 1.01, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.92 to 1.10), and the proportion of rectal cancer diagnosed in adults younger than age 55 years doubled from 14.6{\%} (95{\%} CI = 14.0{\%} to 15.2{\%}) to 29.2{\%} (95{\%} CI = 28.5{\%} to 29.9{\%}). Age-specific relative risk by birth cohort declined from circa 1890 until 1950, but continuously increased through 1990. Consequently, compared with adults born circa 1950, those born circa 1990 have double the risk of colon cancer (IRR = 2.40, 95{\%} CI = 1.11 to 5.19) and quadruple the risk of rectal cancer (IRR = 4.32, 95{\%} CI = 2.19 to 8.51). Conclusions: Age-specific CRC risk has escalated back to the level of those born circa 1890 for contemporary birth cohorts, underscoring the need for increased awareness among clinicians and the general public, as well as etiologic research to elucidate causes for the trend. Further, as nearly one-third of rectal cancer patients are younger than age 55 years, screening initiation before age 50 years should be considered.},

abstract = {Obesity and related metabolic disorders have become globally prevalent posing a challenge for the chronically damaged liver and predisposing the development and progression of cancer. The rising phenomenon of “obesity epidemic” may provide means for understanding why liver cancer is one of the few malignancies with rising incidence in developed countries over the last decades. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes is an increasingly recognized trigger for liver cancer in Western populations characterized by low prevalence of established risk factors for liver cancer such as viral hepatitis and hepatotoxin exposure. Accumulating evidence has established an association between higher body mass index as an indicator of general obesity and higher risk of primary liver cancer. The associations are stronger in men, in patients with underlying liver disease and in white ethnic groups. Abdominal obesity, weight gain in adult life and metabolic factors related to visceral fat accumulation were also suggested as important risk factors for liver cancer; however, more studies are needed to evaluate these associations. The association of obesity and metabolic parameters with liver cancer survival remains controversial. It is unclear which exact mechanisms could provide links between obesity and liver cancer risk. Recent evidence has implicated several molecular pathways in obesity-associated liver cancer. These include insulin resistance leading to increased levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factors, chronic inflammation, adipose tissue remodeling, pro-inflammatory cytokine and adipokine secretion, and altered gut microbiota. These mechanisms coincide with inflammatory and metabolic processes occurring in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease predisposing cancer development and progression. In the context of the current evidence, better understanding of the role of obesity and related metabolic factors may help in improving current strategies for liver cancer prevention.},

abstract = {Objective: To describe primary care physician (PCP) use and continuity of PCP care across the breast cancer care continuum. Design: Population-based, retrospective cohort study using provincial cancer registries linked to health administrative databases. Setting: British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. Participants: All women with incident invasive breast cancer from 2007 to 2012 in Manitoba and Ontario and from 2007 to 2011 in British Columbia. Main outcome measures: The number and proportions of visits to PCPs were determined. Continuity of care was measured using the Usual Provider of Care index calculated as the proportion of visits to the most-often-visited PCP in the 6 to 30 months before a breast cancer diagnosis (baseline) and from 1 to 3 years following a breast cancer diagnosis (survivorship). Results: More than three-quarters of patients visited their PCPs 2 or more times during the breast cancer diagnostic period, and more than 80{\%} of patients had at least 1 PCP visit during breast cancer adjuvant treatment. Contact with the PCP decreased over time during breast cancer survivorship. Of the 3 phases, women appeared to be most likely to not have PCP contact during adjuvant treatment, with 10.7{\%} (Ontario) to 18.7{\%} (British Columbia) of women having no PCP visits during this phase. However, a sizable minority of women had at least monthly visits during the treatment phase, particularly in Manitoba and Ontario, where approximately a quarter of women saw a PCP at least monthly. We observed higher continuity of care with PCPs in survivorship (compared with baseline) in all provinces.

abstract = {In most areas of the world, thyroid cancer incidence has been appreciably increasing over the last few decades, whereas mortality has steadily declined. We updated global trends in thyroid cancer mortality and incidence using official mortality data from the World Health Organization (1970-2012) and incidence data from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (1960-2007). Male mortality declined in all the major countries considered, with annual percent changes around 22/23{\%} over the last decades. Only in the United States mortality declined up to the mid 1980s and increased thereafter. Similarly, in women mortality declined in most countries considered, with APCs around 22/25{\%} over the last decades, with the exception of the UK, the United States and Australia, where mortality has been declining up to the late 1980s/late 1990s to level off (or increase) thereafter. In 2008- 2012, most countries had mortality rates (age-standardized, world population) between 0.20 and 0.40/100,000 men and 0.20 and 0.60/100,000 women, the highest rates being in Latvia, Hungary, the Republic of Moldova and Israel (over 0.40/100,000) for men and in Ecuador, Colombia and Israel (over 0.60/100,000) for women. In most countries, a steady increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer (mainly papillary carcinomas) was observed in both sexes. The declines in thyroid cancer mortality reflect both variations in risk factor exposure and changes in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, while the increases in the incidence are likely due to the increase in the detection of this neoplasm over the last few decades.},

abstract = {Changes in the incidence of oral cancer based on anatomic location and demographic factors over time have been reported in the United States. The purpose of this study was to use recent data to examine oral cancer incidence trends and disparities by demographic factors and anatomic location. Methods: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) incidence data from 2000 to 2010 were used to characterize and analyze oral cancer incidence trends by anatomic region and subsite, age at diagnosis, gender, race/ethnicity, and stage at diagnosis. Poisson regression was used to compare incidence risk by select demographic factors. Results: About 75,468 incident oral cancer cases were diagnosed from 2000 to 2010. The tonsil was the most frequently diagnosed anatomic subsite (23.1{\%}) and the subsite with the greatest contribution to the overall, age-standardized cumulative incidence rate of 8.4 cases per 100,000 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 8.3, 8.4). An increasing incidence trend was observed for cancers in the oropharyngeal region, in contrast to a decreasing trend seen in the oral cavity region. In the Poisson regression model, all race/ethnicity groups showed a lower incidence risk relative to whites for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer, and white males displayed the highest incidence rate of all race/ethnicity-gender groups during the study period (14.1 per 100,000; 95{\%} CI: 14.0, 14.2). Conclusions: This study's epidemiological findings are especially important for oral health care providers, patient education, and the identification of risk profiles associated with oral cancer. The distinct epidemiological trends of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers dictate that oral cancer can no longer be viewed as a discrete entity. Oral health providers should have a strong understanding of the different risk factors associated with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers and educate their patients accordingly.},

abstract = {Background High body-mass index (BMI) predisposes to several site-specific cancers, but a large-scale systematic and detailed characterisation of patterns of risk across all common cancers adjusted for potential confounders has not previously been undertaken. We aimed to investigate the links between BMI and the most common site-specific cancers. Methods With primary care data from individuals in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink with BMI data, we fitted Cox models to investigate associations between BMI and 22 of the most common cancers, adjusting for potential confounders. We fitted linear then non-linear (spline) models; investigated effect modification by sex, menopausal status, smoking, and age; and calculated population effects. Findings 5{\textperiodcentered}24 million individuals were included; 166 955 developed cancers of interest. BMI was associated with 17 of 22 cancers, but effects varied substantially by site. Each 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was roughly linearly associated with cancers of the uterus (hazard ratio [HR] 1{\textperiodcentered}62, 99{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}56-1{\textperiodcentered}69; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), gallbladder (1{\textperiodcentered}31, 1{\textperiodcentered}12-1{\textperiodcentered}52; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), kidney (1{\textperiodcentered}25, 1{\textperiodcentered}17-1{\textperiodcentered}33; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), cervix (1{\textperiodcentered}10, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}17; p=0{\textperiodcentered}00035), thyroid (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}00-1{\textperiodcentered}19; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0088), and leukaemia (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}05-1{\textperiodcentered}13; p{\textless}{\textperiodcentered}0001). BMI was positively associated with liver (1{\textperiodcentered}19, 1{\textperiodcentered}27), colon (1{\textperiodcentered}10, 1{\textperiodcentered}13), ovarian (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1.04-1.14), and postmenopausal breast cancers (1{\textperiodcentered}05, 1{\textperiodcentered}07) overall (all p;lt{\textperiodcentered}0001), but these effects varied by underlying BMI or individual-level characteristics. We estimated inverse associations with prostate and premenopausal breast cancer risk, both overall (prostate 0{\textperiodcentered}98, 0;middotmiddot premenopausal breast cancer 0{\textperiodcentered}89, 0{\textperiodcentered}92) and in never-smokers (prostate 0{\textperiodcentered}96, 0;middotmiddot premenopausal breast cancer 0{\textperiodcentered}89, 0{\textperiodcentered}94). By contrast, for lung and oral cavity cancer, we observed no association in never smokers (lung 0{\textperiodcentered}99, 0;middotmiddot oral cavity 1{\textperiodcentered}07, 0{\textperiodcentered}26): inverse associations overall were driven by current smokers and ex-smokers, probably because of residual confounding by smoking amount. Assuming causality, 41{\%} of uterine and 10{\%} or more of gallbladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers could be attributable to excess weight. We estimated that a 1 kg/m2 population-wide increase in BMI would result in 3790 additional annual UK patients developing one of the ten cancers positively associated with BMI. Interpretation BMI is associated with cancer risk, with substantial population-level effects. The heterogeneity in the effects suggests that different mechanisms are associated with different cancer sites and different patient subgroups.

abstract = {Purpose: Smoking has declined in Canada in recent years. However, it is not clear whether differences in current smoking by socioeconomic status have increased, decreased, or remained unchanged in Canada. Methods: We examined rates of current smoking by sex, education, and province from 1950 to 2011. Differences in current smoking, initiation, and cessation were summarized using relative and absolute measures. Results: Between 1950 and 2011, the prevalence of current smoking (including daily and non-daily) among adults aged 20 years and older decreased steadily in men from 68.9 {\%} (95 {\%} CI 63.9-73.3) to 18.6 {\%} (14.9-22.1) but in women increased slightly from 38.2 {\%} (32.3-42.2) in 1950 to 39.1 {\%} (36.4-41.2) in 1959 before declining to 15.4 {\%} (11.9-18.9) in 2011. Among men, there was an inverse association between educational attainment and smoking which was consistent from 1950 to 2011. A similar gradient emerged in the mid-1960s in women. Absolute differences in rates of smoking across levels of education increased despite overall declines in smoking across all levels of education. Rates of smoking in women and men were higher in the Atlantic Provinces and Quebec, although in men these differences have declined since the 1990s. In a subset of data from 1999 to 2011, those with lower levels of education had higher levels of smoking initiation and lower levels of cessation. Conclusions: Smoking rates have fallen over time but socioeconomic differences have increased. Smoking prevalence peaked later in lower socioeconomic status (SES) groups, and rates of decline in lower SES groups and certain provinces have been less steep. This suggests that SES gradients emerge rapidly in later stages of the tobacco epidemic and may have increased through greater efficacy of tobacco control policies in reducing smoking among those of higher SES compared to those of lower SES. Tailored approaches may be required to reduce smoking rates in those of lower SES and narrow SES differences. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Numerous studies have proposed that the cause is increasing detection due to availability and use of medical diagnostic ultrasound. Our objective was to compare rates of diagnosis across different health-care regions to rates of diagnostic tests and to features of both health and access of the regional populations. This is a population-based retrospective ecological observational study of 12,959 patients with thyroid cancer between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2008 in Ontario Canada based on the health-care utilization regions (Local Health Integration Networks) of the province of Ontario Canada. We found that some regions of Ontario had four times the rates of diagnosis of thyroid cancer compared to other regions. The regions with the highest use of discretionary medical tests (pelvic ultrasound, abdominal ultrasound, neck ultrasound, echocardiogram, resting electrocardiogram, cardiac nuclear perfusion tests, and bone scan), highest population density, and better education had the highest rates of thyroid cancer diagnoses. Differences in the rates of the ordering of discretionary diagnostic medical tests, such as diagnostic ultrasound, in different geographic regions of Ontario lead to differences in the rates of diagnosis of thyroid cancer.},

abstract = {Objective: To describe the socioeconomic and geographic distribution of smoking behaviour in Canada among 19,383 individuals (51{\%} women) aged 15-85 years. Methods: Current smoking and quitting were modeled using standard and multilevel logistic regression. Markers of socioeconomic status (SES) were education and occupation. Geography was defined by Canadian Provinces. Results: The adjusted prevalence of current smoking was 20.2{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 18.8-21.7) and 63.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 61.1-66.3) of ever smokers had quit. Current smoking decreased and quitting increased with increasing SES. The adjusted prevalence of current smoking was 32.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 28.4-37.5) among the least educated compared to 11.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 8.9-13.4) for the highest educated. Among the least educated, 53.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 46.8-59.2) had quit, rising to 68.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 62.7-74.1) for the most educated. There was substantial variation in current smoking and quitting at the provincial level; current smoking varied from 17.9{\%} in British Columbia to 26.1{\%} in Nova Scotia, and quitting varied from 57.4{\%} in Nova Scotia to 67.8{\%} in Prince Edward Island. Nationally, increasing education and occupation level were inversely associated with current smoking (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, 95{\%} CI: 0.60-0.68 for education; OR 0.82, 95{\%} CI: 0.77-0.87 for occupation) and positively associated with quitting (OR 1.27, 95{\%} CI: 1.16-1.40 for education; OR 1.20, 95{\%} CI: 1.12-1.27 for occupation). These associations were consistent in direction across provinces although with some variability in magnitude. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that socioeconomic inequalities in smoking have persisted in Canada; current smoking was less likely and quitting was more likely among the better off groups and in certain provinces. Current prevention and cessation policies have not been successful in improving the situation for all areas and groups. Future efforts to reduce smoking uptake and increase cessation in Canada will need consideration of socioeconomic and geographic factors to be successful. {\textcopyright} 2013 Corsi et al.},

abstract = {Background. In the last decades, thyroid cancer incidence has continuously and sharply increased all over the world. This review analyzes the possible reasons of this increase. Summary. Many experts believe that the increased incidence of thyroid cancer is apparent, because of the increased detection of small cancers in the preclinical stage. However, a true increase is also possible, as suggested by the observation that large tumors have also increased and gender differences and birth cohort effects are present. Moreover, thyroid cancer mortality, in spite of earlier diagnosis and better treatment, has not decreased but is rather increasing. Therefore, some environmental carcinogens in the industrialized lifestyle may have specifically affected the thyroid. Among potential carcinogens, the increased exposure to medical radiations is the most likely risk factor. Other factors specific for the thyroid like increased iodine intake and increased prevalence of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis cannot be excluded, while other factors like the increasing prevalence of obesity are not specific for the thyroid. Conclusions. The increased incidence of thyroid cancer is most likely due to a combination of an apparent increase due to more sensitive diagnostic procedures and of a true increase, a possible consequence of increased population exposure to radiation and to other still unrecognized carcinogens. {\textcopyright} 2013 Gabriella Pellegriti et al.},

Methods Data from five prospective U.S. studies were standardized and then combined into one aggregate dataset (384,433 men and 361,664 women). Pooled hazard ratios (HR) and 95 {\%} confidence intervals (CI) for thyroid cancer were estimated from mutually adjusted models of cigarette smoking and alcohol intake, which were additionally adjusted for age, sex, education, race, marital status, body mass index, and cohort. Results Over follow-up, 1,003 incident thyroid cancer cases (335 men and 668 women) were identified. Compared to never smokers, current smoking was associated with reduced risk of thyroid cancer (HR = 0.68, 95 {\%} CI 0.55-0.85); this association was slightly stronger among nondrinkers (HR = 0.46, 95 {\%} CI 0.29-0.74). No reduction in risk was observed for former, compared to never, smokers. Greater smoking intensity, duration, and pack-years were associated with further reductions in risk among former and current smokers. Alcohol intake was also inversely associated with thyroid cancer risk (C7 drinks/week versus 0, HR = 0.72, 95 {\%} CI 0.58-0.90, p trend = 0.002). Inverse associations with smoking and alcohol were more pronounced for papillary versus follicular tumors.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Esophageal adenocarcinoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates and one of the lowest survival rates of any cancer type in the Western world. However, in many countries, trends in esophageal cancer differ according to tumour morphology and anatomical location. In Canada, incidence and survival trends for esophageal cancer subtypes are poorly known. METHODS: Cancer incidence and mortality rates were obtained from the Canadian Cancer Registry, the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System and the Canadian Vital Statistics Death databases for the period from 1986 to 2006. Observed trends (annual per cent change) and five-year relative survival ratios were estimated separately for esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and according to location (upper, middle, or lower one-third of the esophagus).Incidence rates were projected up to the year 2026. RESULTS: Annual age-standardized incidence rates for esophageal cancer in 2004 to 2006 were 6.1 and 1.7 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively. Esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence rose by 3.9{\%} (males) and 3.6{\%} (females) per year for the period 1986 to 2006, with the steepest increase in the lower one-third of the esophagus (4.8{\%} and 5.0{\%} per year among males and females, respectively). In contrast, squamous cell carcinoma incidence declined by 3.3{\%} (males) and 3.2{\%} (females) per year since the early 1990s. The five-year relative survival ratio for esophageal cancer was 13{\%} between 2004 and 2006, approximately a 3{\%} increase since the period from 1992 to 1994. Projected incidence rates showed increases of 40{\%} to 50{\%} for esophageal adenocarcinoma and decreases of 30{\%} for squamous cell carcinoma by 2026. DISCUSSION: Although esophageal cancer is rare in Canada, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has doubled in the past 20 years, which may reflect the increasing prevalence of obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Declines in squamous cell carcinoma may be the result of the decreases in the prevalence of smoking in Canada. Given the low survival rates and the potential for further increases in incidence, esophageal adenocarcinoma warrants close attention. {\textcopyright}2012 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Multiple myelomas are a less frequent cancer site among both sexes. On a worldwide scale, it is estimated that about 86 000 incident cases occur annually, accounting for about 0.8{\%} of all new cancer cases. About 63 000 subjects are reported to die from the disease each year, accounting for 0.9{\%} of all cancer deaths. Geographically, the frequency is very unevenly distributed in the world with the highest incidence in the industrialised regions of Australia / New Zealand, Europe and North America. Incidence and mortality seem to be stable in Asian countries and to increase slowly over the decades among whites in the western countries. The etiology is poorly understood. This depends partly upon the fact that the risk factors which play a major role for malignant diseases in general, such as tobacco consumption and diet have not been found strongly involved into multiple myeloma etiology. Nevertheless, some consistency seems to be in the findings about a risk elevation with obesity and a slightly decreased risk with high fruit consumption. Despite some contradicting results, indications to a role of ionising radiation persist. Finally, infections with HIV and hepatitis C virus appear related to an elevated multiple myeloma risk. Currently, large efforts are undertaken to unravel the etiology of malignant lymphoma including those of multiple myeloma. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a growing recognition of the involvement of human papilloma virus infection in the etiology of head and neck cancers at some sites, mainly the base of the tongue, tonsils, and other oropharynx (hereafter termed oropharyngeal cancer). Other oral sites (hereafter termed oral cavity cancer [OCC]) show a stronger association with tobacco and alcohol. Little is known about the ethnic variation in incidence for these cancers. This study determined incidence rates of OCC and oropharyngeal cancer among South Asian, Chinese, and the general population in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: Patients with OCC and oropharyngeal cancer diagnosed from 1980 to 2006 were identified through the British Columbia cancer registry, and surname lists were used to establish ethnicity. Age-adjusted incidence rates were determined for these cancers by sex, topographical site, and ethnicity, and temporal trends were examined. RESULTS: Age-adjusted incidence rates have been decreasing for OCC and increasing for oropharyngeal cancer in the general population for both sexes, with men having higher incidence rates than women. Ethnic differences were found, with the highest age-adjusted incidence rates for OCC for men in South Asians and for women in Chinese, and with the highest age-adjusted incidence rates for oropharyngeal cancer for men in Chinese and for women in the general population. Differences were also found for OCC topographical sites by sex and ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer has now surpassed OCC in the British Columbia male population. Ethnic minorities are at higher risk than the general population for both OCC and oropharyngeal cancer for men, and for OCC for women. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Cancer Society.},

Over the same period there have been changes in the management of the disease and, in particular, the use of androgen ablation. We set out to examine the relation between changes in prostate cancer incidence (a surrogate for PSA screening) and subsequent changes in mortality in regions using common treatment recommendations. Methods: We used data from prostate cancer cases and deaths reported to the British Columbia Cancer Registry during 1985-1999 to examine trends in incidence and mortality in 88 small health areas (SHAs) among men aged 50-74 years. We conducted 2 analyses. In the first we classified the SHAs by intensity of PSA screening (low, medium or high) according to their ranked age-standardized incidence rate of prostate cancer in 1990-1994 and examined subsequent trends in prostate cancer mortality. In the second analysis we examined the SHA-specific relative change in prostate cancer incidence between 1985-1989 and 1990-1994 and correlated it with the relative change in mortality for cases diagnosed after 1990. Results: Between 1985-1989 and 1990-1994 the incidence of prostate cancer increased by 53.2{\%} and 14.6{\%} among men aged 50-74 and those 75 and over respectively. Between 1985-1989 and 1995-1999 prostate cancer mortality declined by 17.6{\%} and 7.9{\%} in the 2 age groups respectively. Among men aged 50-74 years SHAs with low, middle and high levels of screening had respective increases in prostate cancer incidence of 5.4{\%}, 53.6{\%} and 70.5{\%} between 1985-1989 and 1990-1994. Corresponding decreases in mortality between 1985-1989 and 1995-1999 were 28.9{\%}, 18.0{\%} and 13.5{\%}. Mortality declines were greatest in SHAs with low screening levels (p = 0.032). Before 1990 prostate cancer mortality was similar in the 3 screening groups (p = 0.72). Regions with the smallest increases in incidence had the largest declines in mortality. Interpretation: We found no association between the intensity of PSA screening and subsequent decreases in prostate cancer mortality.},
